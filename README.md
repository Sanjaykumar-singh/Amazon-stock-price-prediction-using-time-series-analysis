### 🚀 **Amazon Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis** 📈

I recently worked on an exciting project where I built a **Time Series Forecasting Model** to predict **Amazon’s stock prices** using historical market data and advanced forecasting techniques.

🔍 **# Forecast Overview**
📊 The model predicts that Amazon’s stock price will **gradually rise from ~$157.6 to ~$159.6** over the next 30 days.
💰 The **average forecasted price** is **$158.61**, slightly higher than the current value of **$157.75**, indicating a **mild upward trend**.

📉 **# Confidence Intervals**

* The **forecast uncertainty widens** over time — from **~8.8 on Day 1** to **~47.3 by Day 30**.
* This shows that **long-term forecasts carry more uncertainty**, while short-term predictions remain more reliable.
* The **expected price range** lies between **$135.97 and $183.26**.

⚖️ **# Risk & Return Analysis**

* **Worst-case scenario:** ~13.8% potential drop 📉
* **Best-case scenario:** ~16.2% possible gain 📈
* **Expected daily fluctuation:** roughly **±10%** around the forecast.

💡 **# Key Insights**
✅ **Short-term forecasts (first 10 days)** are more dependable due to narrower confidence ranges.
⚠️ **Long-term forecasts** show growing uncertainty, emphasizing the need for cautious decision-making.
📈 The **trend is slightly bullish**, but **volatility increases** as we move further into the forecast horizon.

📊 Tools & Techniques used: **Python, Plotly, Time Series Modeling, ARIMA, Forecast Evaluation, and Confidence Interval Visualization.**
